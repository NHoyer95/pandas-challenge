# pandas-challenge

This repo contains a demonstration of pandas scripting in a jupyter notebook to analyze data from a school district.

Key Metrics found:
- Total students, budget, and more for the entire district
- A summary of the total students, per student budget, and more organized by school
- Math and reading scores plus passing rates for those subjects by school, by grade, by school size, by school type, and by school budget per student

The PyCitySchools folder contains a .ipynb file with the dataframes created to analyze the .csv files in Resources. My personal analysis of the trends seen in this data can be found in the .txt file.
